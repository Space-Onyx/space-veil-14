guidebook-onyx-body-part-damage-content =
    # Localized damage
    Blunt, slash, piercing, thermal, electrical, and caustic damage affects individual body parts. Suffocation, radiation, and other general conditions affect the whole body.

guidebook-onyx-body-part-damage-examination =
    ## Examination
    The health analyzer lists damage, wounds, pain, bleeding, and function for each part. Select an area on the targeting doll before treatment. Without a selection, treatment finds the most damaged compatible part.

guidebook-onyx-body-part-damage-difference =
    ## Damage and wounds
    Body-part damage counts toward overall health. A wound is a separate result of a strong hit: a cut, burn, electrical injury, fracture, or structural defect. Damage can be removed while a wound and its effects remain.
    Material is checked per selected part. A cybernetic limb on an organic patient is repaired as a machine, while the adjacent living limb is treated as tissue.

guidebook-onyx-body-part-damage-protection =
    ## Trauma protection
    Ordinary armor modifiers reduce direct damage. [bold]Trauma protection[/bold] separately reduces the chance of fractures, organ damage, nerve damage, and dismemberment on covered parts.
    Coverage still comes from the armor's listed body parts and side. The head and pelvis also have intrinsic resistance to dismemberment. Multiple worn sources add together; specialized equipment may fully prevent a particular trauma without making the wearer immune to direct damage.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-content =
    # Wounds
    A sufficiently strong individual hit creates a wound. Weak hits usually deal damage only. Later hits worsen an existing wound.
    An [bold]open[/bold] wound has its full effects. A [bold]stabilized[/bold] wound is treated but not healed. A [bold]closed[/bold] wound is physically sealed. Another strong hit can reopen it.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-effects =
    ## Effects
    Wounds progress through minor, moderate, severe, and critical stages. Pain, bleeding, and loss of limb function increase with severity.
    Internal bleeding leaves no puddles and is revealed by an analyzer. A fracture is separate from blunt damage and needs separate treatment. Damaged organs also require their own treatment.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-traumatic-heading =
    ## Common trauma

guidebook-onyx-wounds-blunt =
    ### Blunt wound
    The result of a strong blunt hit. It causes pain and may bleed slightly; severe stages impair the part, while critical stages disable it.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-slash =
    ### Slash wound
    An open wound caused by slash damage. It bleeds more reliably than a blunt wound, causes pain, and compromises part function at severe stages.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-piercing =
    ### Piercing wound
    A deep puncture. It is usually more painful and bleeds more heavily than a slash wound; severe punctures impair or disable the part.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-burn =
    ### Burn wound
    The result of heat, cold, or caustic exposure. Its main danger is increasing pain, and it may scar suitable tissue. Thermal and caustic trauma share this wound type.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-electrical =
    ### Electrical wound
    A lasting consequence of a strong electrical discharge. It causes one-time pain; severe stages impair the part and critical stages disable it. It is treated separately from an ordinary burn.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-special-heading =
    ## Special wounds

guidebook-onyx-wounds-fracture =
    ### Fracture
    Separate bone damage ranging from a hairline crack to a comminuted fracture. It causes pain and functional penalties. Reduction temporarily weakens its effects; mending removes it.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-organs-nerves =
    ### Organs and nerves
    Hits of at least 15 localized damage may injure an organ inside the struck part. The affected organ and received damage depend on organ exposure and damage type. Below one quarter health an organ stops providing its function, but remains surgically repairable; at zero it is destroyed and may cause internal bleeding.
    Hits of at least 5 damage may cause nerve trauma. Damaged nerves amplify real pain while making the patient feel less of it, so apparent pain can hide worsening trauma. Nerve damage persists until surgically repaired.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-incision =
    ### Surgical incision
    An intentional open wound used to access deep procedures. It bleeds, especially while the patient is awake, and must be closed after work is complete.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-dismemberment-wound =
    ### Dismemberment wound
    A bleeding injury created when a part is lost. It represents the fresh severed surface and requires bleeding control.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-amputation-consequence =
    ### Amputation consequence
    The state of an untreated stump. Ordinary damage healing does not remove it; a separate surgical procedure is required before safe part attachment.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-internal-bleeding =
    ### Internal bleeding
    Blood loss into the body after destruction of a suitable organ. It produces no external puddle, appears on an analyzer, and is removed by a separate operation.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-medical-scar =
    ### Medical scar
    A record of completed treatment. It deals no damage and causes no functional penalty by itself; it marks prior trauma on tissue capable of scarring.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-material-heading =
    ## Part material

guidebook-onyx-wounds-slime-plant =
    ### Slime and plants
    Slime and plant tissue use their own blunt, slash, piercing, and burn wound variants. Their meaning and stages match common trauma, but each wound belongs to its part material and requires compatible biological treatment.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-ipc-mechanical =
    ### IPC mechanical damage
    Dents, casing tears, punctures, thermal deformation, and corrosion of IPC parts form one structural wound. It causes pain and leaks oil; it impairs function from the moderate stage and disables the part from the severe stage.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-cybernetic-mechanical =
    ### Cybernetic mechanical damage
    The equivalent structural wound of an installed cybernetic prosthesis. A cybernetic prosthesis feels no pain and does not bleed, even on an organic patient. It requires welding repair rather than biological supplies.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-material-electrical =
    ### Electrical wounds by material
    Electrical wounds are shared by living, plant, slime, and mechanical parts, but treatment must match material: suitable wound treatment for biological parts and an LV cable coil for mechanical parts.

guidebook-onyx-wounds-dismemberment =
    ## Dismemberment
    Dismemberment has two phases. Accumulated structural damage first leaves a limb ready to sever. Another strong blunt, slash, or piercing hit completes the amputation. Repairing below the dangerous level removes this state.
    A missing part loses all of its functions. Its stump needs separate treatment; reducing overall damage does not replace that procedure.
    Explosions distribute damage unevenly and choose one eligible limb as an amputation candidate. Dismemberment chance rises with structural damage and fracture severity, while intrinsic and worn trauma protection reduce it. The torso cannot be severed this way.

guidebook-onyx-wound-treatment-content =
    # Wound treatment
    1. Restore breathing and stabilize critical condition.
    2. Stop major external bleeding.
    3. Scan the patient and select the damaged part.
    4. Remove damage with treatment matching its material.
    5. Scan again: remaining wounds need separate treatment.

guidebook-onyx-wound-treatment-biological =
    ## Biological tissue
    { "[" }bold]Bruise packs and ointment:[/bold] remove damage, not wounds.
    { "[" }bold]Gauze:[/bold] reduces external bleeding.
    { "[" }bold]Medicated sutures and regenerative mesh:[/bold] treat damage and minor wounds.
    { "[" }bold]Moderate wound:[/bold] external surgical treatment.
    { "[" }bold]Severe wound:[/bold] treatment through an open incision.

guidebook-onyx-wound-treatment-chemistry =
    ## Medicine
    Healing reagents distribute their effect among damaged biological parts. They do not repair Integrated Positronic Chassis or cybernetic prostheses. Damage and wounds remain separate: medicine that removes damage does not necessarily close a wound.

guidebook-onyx-wound-treatment-fractures =
    ## Fractures
    Fractures are mended with bone gel through an open incision.
    Nerve trauma is repaired with surgical stitches through an open incision. Medicine cannot mend fractures or nerves.

guidebook-onyx-wound-treatment-mechanical =
    ## IPCs and cybernetics
    Welding tools and synthetic repair tools have two modes. [bold]Mechanical[/bold] repairs dents, cuts, and punctures. [bold]Physical[/bold] repairs heat, cold, and caustic corrosion. Each cycle affects only the selected group.
    A welding tool is weaker and slower. The dedicated tool is more effective, but both consume welding fuel and must be active. An LV cable coil repairs electrical damage and electrical wounds. Biological supplies and medicine do not affect mechanical parts.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-content =
    # Surgery
    Surgery treats moderate and severe wounds, internal bleeding, fractures, organs, amputation stumps, and body-part installation. Each operation requires a suitable patient state and selected area.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-procedure =
    ## Procedure
    1. Lay down and anesthetize the patient.
    2. Select a body part and operation.
    3. Hold the required tool in your active hand.
    4. Perform the steps shown by the interface in order.
    5. Finish treatment, then close the incision separately.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-tools =
    A scalpel makes an incision. A hemostat clamps vessels. A retractor opens access. A cautery seals tissue. Bones require bone gel. A wrong tool can harm the patient.
    Improvised tools can satisfy the same task but work slower and have a lower success rate. A failed invasive step causes additional localized trauma instead of silently doing nothing.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-diagnostics =
    ## Reading the analyzer
    Each affected part is shown as a separate block. Wounds, fracture grade, external and internal bleeding rate, pain, nerve condition, and lost function appear on separate lines.
    Organ rows show both a percentage and a state: healthy, damaged, critical, or destroyed. Critical organs no longer provide their normal function but can still be repaired surgically.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-access =
    ## Access depth
    External moderate wounds need no deep access. Severe and critical wounds require an open incision. The heart and lungs lie behind the ribcage; the liver, kidneys, and appendix lie behind the abdominal wall. Removing, inserting, and treating the same organ uses the same access depth.
    Internal bleeding, organ treatment, wound treatment, fracture mending, and incision closure are separate operations. Complete the needed results before closing the patient.

guidebook-onyx-surgery-synthetics =
    ## IPCs
    IPC operations begin by releasing fasteners, disconnecting wiring, and opening a panel. After work, reconnect the part, close the panel, and secure it. A repair tool fixes part damage but does not replace organ or limb installation.
    { "[" }color=red][bold]Do not cut into a patient without anesthesia unless delay is more dangerous.[/bold][/color]
